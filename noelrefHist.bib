	Abstract = {How did modern and centralized fiscal institutions emerge? We develop a model that explains (i) why pre-industrial states relied on private individuals to collect taxes; (ii) why after 1600 both England and France moved from competitive methods for collecting revenues to allocating the right to collect taxes to a small group of financiers---a intermediate institution that we call cabal tax farming---and (iii) why this centralization led to investments in fiscal capacity and increased fiscal standardization. We provide detailed historical evidence that supports our prediction that rulers abandoned the competitive allocation of tax rights in favor of cabal tax farming in order to gain access to inside credit and that this transition was accompanied by investments in standardization. Finally (iv) we show why this intermediate institution proved to be self-undermining in England where it was quickly replaced by direct collection, but lasted in France until the French Revolution.},

@article{Koyama12b,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between the historical process of legal centralization and increased religious toleration by the state. We develop a model in which legal centralization leads to the criminalization of the religious beliefs of a large proportion of the population. This process initially leads to increased persecution, but, because these persecutions are costly, it eventually causes the state to broaden the standards of orthodox belief and move toward religious toleration. We compare the results of the model with historical evidence drawn from two important cases in which religious diversity and state centralization collided in France: the Albigensian crusades of the thirteenth century and the rise of Protestant belief in the sixteenth century. Both instances sup- port our central claim that the secularization of western European state institutions during the early-modern period was driven by the costs of imposing a common set of legal standards on religiously diverse populations.},

	Abstract = {**Revised version 2005** This paper empirically examines the New Deal's impact on local economic activity, as measured by retail sales, during the 1930s. Using a recently-uncovered data set that describes over 30 federal New Deal spending, loan, and mortgage insurance programs across all U.S. counties from 1933 to 1939, we estimate how the various New Deal programs that were designed to accomplish different objectives influenced retail spending. Our empirical approach accounts for both the simultaneity between New Deal allocations and economic activity and the geographic spillovers that likely resulted when spending in one county may have affected the economies of its neighbors. We find that New Deal spending on public works tended to promote retail sales in both the county where the money was spent and in contiguous neighbors, while spending on work relief increased economic activity in the county where the money was spent but at the expense of neighboring counties. Agricultural spending that limited production was associated with lower retail spending. New Deal loan programs appear to have had little or a somewhat negative effect. Finally, increases in the value of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration had a strong positive effect on local economic growth during the Depression.},

Our results show that the introduction of the potato was responsible for a significant portion of the increase in population and urbanization observed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. According to our most conservative estimates, the introduction of the potato accounts for approximately one-quarter of the growth in Old World population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900. Additional evidence from within-country comparisons of city populations and adult heights also confirms the cross-country findings.},

	Abstract = { What is the greatest single class of distortions in the global economy? One contender for this title is the tightly binding constraints on emigration from poor countries. Vast numbers of people in low-income countries want to emigrate from those countries but cannot. How large are the economic losses caused by barriers to emigration? Research on this question has been distinguished by its rarity and obscurity, but the few estimates we have should make economists' jaws hit their desks. The gains to eliminating migration barriers amount to large fractions of world GDP\&#8212;one or two orders of magnitude larger than the gains from dropping all remaining restrictions on international flows of goods and capital. When it comes to policies that restrict emigration, there appear to be trillion-dollar bills on the sidewalk.},

We use data on 69 countries between 1870 and 2000 to show that political instability does not always affect growth outcomes. We then develop a simple model to explain this fact in which the likelihood that \&quot;good\&quot; institutions are abandoned during periods of political uncertainty depends on the opportunity cost of doing so. We operationalize our model by using contract intensive money as a proxy for this initial investment in growth-enhancing institutions. Cross-sectional and panel growth regressions support the model's predictions. Copyright 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Why do seemingly irrational superstitions persist? We analyze the widely held belief among Asians that children born in the Year of the dragon are superior. We use pooled cross section data from the U.S. Current Population Survey to show that Asian immigrants to the United States born in the 1976 year of the dragon are more educated than comparable immigrants from non-dragon years. In contrast, no such educational effect is noticeable for dragon-year children in the general U.S. population. We also provide evidence that Asian mothers of dragon year babies are more educated, richer, and slightly older than Asian mothers of non-dragon year children. This suggests that belief in the greater superiority of dragon-year children is self-fulfilling since the demographic characteristics associated with parents who are more willing and able to adjust their birthing strategies to have dragon children are also correlated with greater investment in their human capital.},

@techreport{GoldinKatz07,
	Abstract = {Cohorts born until the late 1940s benefited from a clear generational progress: from one generation to the next, the conditions for entering the labour market were more favourable, living standards increased regularly, access to education and homeownership was more common. These progresses strongly slowed down and even stopped, for generations born in the 1950s and 1960s. Early in their life course, the latter had to face the two oil shocks and the bad economic context that followed. The most recent generations are experiencing a mixed picture. Several years of good economic performance at the turn of the 2000s helped to increase again their standard of living in comparison to previous generations at the same age. Then, they benefited from low interest rates that facilitated again access to the property, despite rising property prices. However, this improvement appears to be very dependent on the macroeconomic environment, which can easily turn around. Inequalities between generations go together with inequalities within generations. In particular, access to employment is closely linked to educational level. Graduate people are more protected from unemployment and get a stable job more easily, but such an improvement is at the cost of a downgrading as regards wages and employment position. Non-graduates, meanwhile, are more dependent on economic conditions, not only at the end of their studies but also during the beginning of their careers. Finally, the fragility of this generational progress, and the increased importance of intergenerational transfers of wealth, could possibly lead to a widening of the gap between social classes or social origins. For instance, since the beginning of the 2000s, the access of younger generations to property has been improving again but the gap in property rates between social categories has been increasing.},

@article{Lindert94,
	Abstract = {This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence that supports the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant monetarist arithmetic\&rdquo; that an increase in public debt is typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

The transcripts of witchcraft trials held before the Inquisition reveal the complexities of early modern conceptions of natural and supernatural. The tribunal found itself entirely unable to convict individuals charged with performing harmful magic, or maleficio, as different worldviews clashed in the courtroom. Physicians, exorcists, and inquisitors all had different approaches to distinguishing natural phenomena from supernatural, and without a consensus guilty verdicts could not be obtained.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the effects of asymmetries in re-election probabilities across parties on public policy and its subsequent propagation to the economy. The struggle between opposing groups {\^a}€'' that disagree on the composition of public consumption {\^a}€'' results in governments being endogenously short-sighted: Systematic under investment in infrastructure and overspending on public goods arise, as resources are more valuable when in power. Because the party enjoying an electoral advantage is relatively less short-sighted, it devotes a larger proportion of government revenues to productive public investment. Political turnover, together with asymmetric policy choices, induces economic fluctuations in an otherwise deterministic environment. The author characterizes the long-run distribution of capital and shows that output increases on average with political advantage, despite the fact that the size of the government expands as a percentage of GDP. Volatility, on the other hand, is non-monotonic in political power and is an additional source of inefficiency.},

@article{Kiser01,
	Abstract = {Although the causal impact of war on state-making in the early modern era is now widely accepted, there is less consensus about the way in which war affects levels of taxation, and the factors that might strengthen or weaken the relationship. Two questions can be posed: Do individual wars produce immediate effects on taxes, or is the cumulative effect of long periods of warfare more important? How do variations in administrative capacity and the strength of representative institutions affect the extent to which war pushes the growth of the state? This article attempts to answer these questions with a quantitative analysis of the effects of war on taxation in early modern England and France. We find that the cumulative effect of war is strong in both cases, suggesting that war made states via a "ratchet effect," and that this effect is much stronger when the administrative capacity of states is improved by centralization and bureaucratization. Strong representative assemblies decrease the effect of war on state growth in France but increase it in England, due to the very different characteristics of these institutions in the two countries.},

We extend their framework by allowing employment to vary over time, at equidistant intervals. When both parties can precommit ex ante not to renogotiate the contract, this replicates the Grossman-Hart outcome each subperiod. When precommitment is not possible, information revealed through the contract can create Pareto improving renegotiation opportunities, and the issue of optimal information revelation arises. The paper analyzes the impact of ex post Pareto-improving renegotiations on the optimal contract.},

@article{Cramise00,
	Abstract = {Financing the crown was, perhaps, the seminal question in the English reign of James VI and I. Attempts to tap commercial wealth were a central feature of fiscal policy. The derivations of crown finance from commerce are straightforward; for instance, customs duties or concessions the crown held in monopolies and patents. The grandest project of James's reign, Alderman Cockayne's project to export dyed and dressed cloth, embodied these commercial-fiscal connections in addition to the goal of economic growth. The same points are exemplified by proposals to construct a fleet of fishing vessels (busses) with which to confront Dutch mastery of the trade. This project also enticed policy-makers and provides a vehicle through which to examine the relationship between crown finance and commerce, the revisionist approach to the structural failures of early Stuart government, and the politics of crown finance. The first section will trace the development of `projects' and the conceptualization of crown finance as a project par excellence. The second section analyses specifically the busses projects. The final section examines the interaction of busses and fiscal policy in the 1610s. The argument is that the ultimate failure of finance was political rather than structural and the basis for this failure lay in the operation of Jacobean kingship upon policy-making.},

	Abstract = {This paper analyzes the choice of contractual forms in tax collection activities.It draws on historical data from the world as a whole to illustrate the factors involved in the choice among wage, share and fixed rent (tax farming) techniques. It also provides a detailed analysis of tax farming as applied to Tunisia's periodic markets so as to explain the continued reliance on this otherwise generally abandoned form of tax collection in this particular sector.Finally, some implications for policy in both developed and developing countries are derived. In diesem Artikel wird die Wahl zwischen unterschiedlichen Vertragsformen fur den Steuereinzug analysiert. Es wird dabei Gebrauch gemacht von historischen Begebenheiten auf der ganzen Welt, um die Fakten zu beleuchten, die bei der Wahl zwischen Lohn-, Anteils-und Festbetragsregelung involviert sind. Des weiteren enth{\"a}lt der Artikel eine detaillierte Analyse der Festbetragsregelung auf Tunesiens Wochenmarkten, um damit das andauernde Festhalten an einer andernorts im allgemeinen abgeschafften Art der Steuererhebung auf diesem speziellen Sektor zu erklaren.AbschlieBendwerdeneinige.SchluBfolgerungen fur die Politik sowohl in entwickelten als auch in unterentwickelten Lander gezogen.},

	Abstract = {We use book translations as a new measure of international idea flows and study the effects of Communism{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s collapse in Eastern Europe on these flows. Using novel data on 800,000 translations, we show that while translations between Communist languages decreased by two thirds with the collapse, Western-to-Communist translations increased by a factor of seven and reached Western levels. Convergence was full in economically-beneficial fields such as sciences and only partial in culturally-beneficial fields such as history. The effects were larger for more Western-oriented countries. These findings help us understand how institutions shape the international diffusion of knowledge. Creation Date: 2010-08 Revision Date:},

	Abstract = { We use individual-level survey and county-level expenditure data to examine the extent to which Hanukkah celebrations among US Jews are driven by the presence of Christmas. We document that Jews with young children are more likely to celebrate Hanukkah, that this effect is greater for reform Jews and for strongly-identified Jews, and that Jewish-related expenditure on Hanukkah is higher in counties with lower shares of Jews. All these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that celebration of religious holidays is designed not only for worship and enjoyment but also to provide a counterbalance for children against competing cultural influences.

	Abstract = {It is conventionally assumed that the pre-modern working year was fixed and that consumption varied with changes in wages and prices. This is challenged by the twin theories of the {\^a}€˜industrious{\^a}€{\texttrademark} revolution and the consumer revolution, positing a longer working year as people earned surplus money to buy novel goods. In this study, we turn the conventional view on its head, fixing consumption rather than labour input. Specifically, we use a basket of basic consumption goods and compute the working year of rural and urban day labourers required to achieve that. By comparing with independent estimates of the actual working year, we find two {\^a}€˜industrious{\^a}€{\texttrademark} revolutions among rural workers; both, however, are attributable to economic hardship, and we detect no signs of a consumer revolution. For urban labourers, by contrast, a growing gap between their actual working year and the work required to buy the basket provides great scope for a consumer revolution.},

	Abstract = {This article examines the distribution of government revenue, and the burden on the economy posed by taxation, in the light of recent debates about the role of demand, the 'crowding-out' effects of war, and the timing of the industrial revolution. An analysis of the burden in terms of real per caput income and in terms of the taxpayer, suggests that taxation may well have exercised negative effects on the economy by slowing down the pace of industrialization from the point of view of home demand. An attempt is made to rejuvenate the debate on the role of taxation as a vital influence on economic development. However, in diverting funds out of consumption successive governments in the eighteenth century used them instead to help finance wars. Undoubtedly there was a leakage back to war- induced demand, but it is just as likely that the main effect of wars was to secure markets and sources of raw materials overseas for future use. The immediate effect may have been to crowd out the industrial revolution, but in the longer term it probably made the industrial revolution more secure.},

Domestic firms operating in sectors where foreign firms are also active have higher total factor productivity. However, the magnitude of such horizontal spillovers depends on the structure and origin of foreign ownership, the export status of firms and the characteristics of the special economic zones firms are operating in.},

The analyses refer to various aspects of the regional economies: wages, bargaining and prices; environmental diseconomies; public capital and competitiveness; disparities in European regions and other countries' experiences; households' financial choices and the difficulties firms face in the South of Italy; and regional policies and federalism. Together with other research, some of the analyses contained in the book provided basic material for the conference on \&quot;The Mezzogiorno and economic policy in Italy\&quot; (Rome, 26 November 2009).},

@article{Carlos92,
	Abstract = {This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence that supports the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant monetarist arithmetic\&rdquo; that an increase in public debt is typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

@article{Clark82,
	Abstract = {Medieval historians have long maintained that social welfare in the com munities of rural England often involved private systems of
support
for the elderly. Individuallv arranged pension plans provide a case in point. The best evidence of these pension plans is found in the records of
manor
courts. To read the records is to learn how pension plans enabled the elderly to adjust their needs to local patterns of production and domestic
structure, to law, to expressions of personal autonomy. and the confines of personal dependency. Simply stated, the old ac commodated their needs for
support by looking to benefactors to manage their lands and tenements. The subsequent arrangement involved a contractual agree ment designed both to
ensure and to supplement familial support, and also, under certain circumstances, to provide a substitute for it. As a result, not even peasants
without children or spouses necessarily experienced dislocation. Contracts assured cooperation. They afforded the partners a way to negotiate mutually
beneficial bargains wherein the conditional transfer of property was meant to guarantee securitv during retirement.

1906
essay, `Churches and Sects,' epitomizes the new economic sociology argument. The piece not only details the origins of and individual motivations
behind social capital formation in sects, it also shows how congregation--based social capital facilitated the emergence of capitalism in America. I
supplement Weber's work with that of contemporary scholars to provide social--capital--based explanations of capitalism in northern Italy, the
Netherlands, and England, all emphasizing the significance of credit.

We show that a separating equilibrium exists where individuals' expenditure on conspicuous consumption is a signal for their unobserved income. In this equilibrium, poor families that climb up the social ladder by the accumulation of wealth engage in conspicuous consumption that prevents them from escaping poverty. Our model may explain why the poor make some choices that do not appear to help them escape poverty. (JEL: D91, O11, O12, O15) (c) 2010 by the European Economic Association.},

Surprisingly, the crown s revenues increased. I present a transaction cost argument to explain the behavior of tax farm lease prices as tax farming changed during the seventeenth century. Cartelization of tax farms lowered costs faced by the crown. The tax farm system s evolution offers insights into how organizations evolve to protect their property rights in the absence of well functioning representative institutions.},

Feinstein{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s historical national accounts for the UK developed out of this project and built on its earlier contributions. He was the foremost constructor of historical accounts in the UK, and shared with other national accounting pioneers a pragmatic approach and a bias against neo-classical general equilibrium. He made important contributions to growth accounting and the measurement of standards of living, and also left his mark as a teacher and as an academic leader. His commitment to racial equality in South Africa preceded his academic career, and continued after his formal retirement.},

In a field experiment using university students, we find that subjects who have been incentivized to exercise increase gym usage more if they have more treated friends. However, control subjects are not influenced by their peers. Findings demonstrate that fraction treated has a large influence on outcomes in this environment, and spillovers vary greatly by treatment status. Results highlight subtle effects of randomization and document a low-cost method for improving the generalizability of controlled interventions in networked environments.},

@article{Lazerwitz73,
	Abstract = {Separated sets of concepts and procedures have developed from studies on the religious and ethnic identifications of Christians and Jews. This article strives to integrate these research streams through a set of eight identification dimensions. Using prior research by Lenski and Sklare, these eight dimensions are formed into two path analysis models-one for Protestants and one for Jews. These models are then evaluated by data from a probability sample of Chicago area Jews and white Protestants. As would be expected, findings only partially support the hypothesized path models. The data indicate that there is a mainstream of identification that runs from childhood home religious background to religious education to religious behavior to activity in ethnic organizations and to concern over one's children's religious education. Lenski's finding that ethnic community life and religious institutions were somewhat separated is supported for Protestants, but not for Jews. These eight identity dimensions are controlled for two recursive blocks of biosocial and socioeconomic variables and are related to general community organization activities, anomie, and a measure of liberalness. The findings for high-moderate status Jews show weak or negative relations between identification measures and liberalness. Low-status Jews show positive relations between five dimensions and liberalness. Protestants display weak relations between their identity dimensions and liberalness with no evidence of an interaction with social status. Finally, two new identity models are presented for further empirical testing.},

@article{Lazerwitz79,
	Abstract = {This paper furthers our understanding of American religious pluralism by analyzing Jewish denominational patterns as revealed by data from the National Jewish Population Survey. A clear ranking among the denominational subgroups emerges, ranging from those identifying with Orthodoxy, to those identifying with Conservative Judaism, Reform, and finally those having no denominational preferences. This last group has the lowest levels of religious and ethnic identification. The subgroups closer to the Orthodox pole have higher levels of Jewish identification and observance, and are somewhat lower in socioeconomic status and voluntary association activities. The socioeconomic differences are considerably smaller than they are known to have been historically, but differences in the degree of Americanization, as indicated by the number of generations in the United States, remain strong. The data also show that marital patterns and certain secular attitudes and behavior are associated with denominational identification and synagogue membership. Analogies are suggested between the ideological and behavioral divisions within American Judaism and those found in Protestantism. Our findings point to the durability of a denominationalism which is becoming increasingly independent of its classic social and economic sources.},

@article{Leeson07a,
	Abstract = {This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence that supports the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant monetarist arithmetic\&rdquo; that an increase in public debt is typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

	Abstract = {Abstract I offer an explanation for the coexistence of joint-liability and individual-liability microcredit contracts. I show that both contracts maximize welfare when credit is rationed due to limited liability, but for different borrowers. Borrowers monitor each other when liability is joint, while the lender monitors individual loans. Joint liability offers poorer borrowers larger loans with less monitoring effort than would have to be exerted by the lender. Individual liability offers the wealthier among credit-constrained borrowers larger loans even without monitoring. The theory explains why individual loans serve the wealthier among poor borrowers and are larger, and why businesses funded with individual loans grow more.},

	Abstract = {There is a counterintuitive gap in the club theory of religion. While it elegantly accounts for the notable success of strict sectarian religious groups in recruiting members and maintaining commitment, it exhibits less satisfactory properties when used to account for groups requiring neither extreme nor zero sacrifice. Such corner solutions, compared to the moderate middle, are rarely observed empirically. Within the original representative agent model, moderate groups are everywhere and always a suboptimal choice for rational, utility maximizing agents. In this paper, we extend the original model to operate within a multi-agent computational context, with heterogeneous agents occupying coordinates in a two dimensional lattice, making repeated decisions over time. Our model offers the possibility of successful moderate groups, including outcomes wherein the population is dominated by moderate groups. The viability of moderate groups is a result of heterogeneous agent wages. Lower wage agents offer greater time contributions, but lesser financial contributions to groups. Higher sacrifice rates incentive greater contributions from members, but reduce private productivity and screen out other potential members with greater financial resources. Moderate groups succeed by offering an optimal balance of these countervailing forces.},

	Abstract = { Economic growth has not led to a decline in religion despite past predictions that it would. Using a formal model of religious competition, I show how economic growth produces counteracting effects on religious activity in an open religious market, and that it has little effect in a religious market that is already secularized due to regulations that prohibit religious competition or in a highly religious market with regulations that inhibit secular activities. Theories predicting the decline of religion due to rising opportunity costs of religious demand and supply ignore countervailing influences.

	Abstract = {The renown or infamy of Henry VIII's Great Debasement (1542 - 1553), which the government of his successor, Edward VI, continued for another six years after his death, has unfairly obscured his earlier and far more modest coinage changes and public-spirited monetary policies. Furthermore, despite the renown of and the ample literature devoted to the Great Debasement this unusual episode in early-modern monetary history still lacks a fully accurate exposition and explanation. For example, did it begin in 1542 or 1544? How did it work, and why and how did it prove to be successful or profitable'. This study seeks to provide such an accurate exposition and explanation, and thus to provide a proper contrast with Henry VIII's earlier coinage changes and monetary policies while also providing a brief comparison with those of Edward IV, whose debasements of 1464-65 were the last undertaken before those of Henry VIII. The subject of coinage debasements remains an arcane subject, ill understood not only by students of European history but also by many of the historians and economists who have published on topics in monetary history. A major problem is that historians have not clearly asked one fundamental question: were debasements fundamentally aggressive or defensive in nature? The second question to be asked is the nature of the goals sought from debasement: were they fundamentally monetary or fiscal? The fiscal aspect of coinage debasements is derived from the fact that in pre-modern western Europe minting was a princely or government monopoly from which the prince or government derived a fee known as seigniorage. The central thesis of this study is that aggressive' coinage debasements were undertaken primarily as fiscal policies to increase mint profits: profits from an increased mint output and from a increased seigniorage rate. In most, of not all cases, the fiscal motive was to finance warfare, even if indirectly. As this study shows, aggressive coinage debasements w},

@article{Nye07b,
	Abstract = {From the late 1600s to the mid 1800s, Britain was able to transform from a divided kingdom with a fragmented, often stagnant economy into a powerful and stable state that simultaneously saw an expansion in the power, wealth, and stability of the central government while encouraging an economic transformation that gradually allowed both industrial technology and liberal commerce to flourish and break out of its mercantilist straitjacket. We explain how rent-seeking elites who might normally have opposed such sweeping transformations promoted institutional changes that, in the long run, expanded the economy and encouraged innovation even at the expense of class interests. In the short run, this meant that rent-seeking in the 18th century was not so much reduced as redirected from local monopolies to state authorities and Parliament. But in the longer run, the process of professionalization made possible greater liberalism in general, even at the expense of general rent-seeking itself. The position of Parliament as a meta-institution for reforming and weakening rent-creating restrictions as needed was pivotal to this process. Ideological changes{\^a}€''particularly the Scottish enlightenment{\^a}€''transformed the terms of the debate but could only be operationalized once interests were aligned so that gainers from industrialization could compensate or overcome traditional interests.},

@article{Pammer98,
	Abstract = { This article examines private Austrian investment in the Hungarian economy as an example of private financial investment in a backward foreign economy in the late nineteenth century. The main finding is the dominant role of Austrian investment in institutional securities such as Hungarian state bonds and bank securities, which comprised a steadily rising proportion in the portfolios of investors. The only other important sector of the Hungarian economy that was invested in directly was the transport system, which depended on the fluctuations in the development of the Hungarian economy rather than on long-term trends. Securities of the manufacturing sector did not attract the interest of most Austrian investors. Banks and the state thus constituted an element of stability in the Hungarian economy and helped it to acquire funds that could not be provided by the domestic market.},

We show (1) STR is a theoretically optimal monetary policy under heterogeneous loan interest rate contracts in both discretionay and commitment monetary policies, (2) however, the optimal response to the credit spread is ambiguous given the financial market structure in theoretically derived STR, and (3) there, a commitment policy is effective in narrowing the credit spread when the central bank hits the zero lower bound constraint of the policy rate.},

@article{Prescott02b,
	Abstract = {This paper provides a survey on studies that analyze the macroeconomic effects of intellectual property rights (IPR). The first part of this paper introduces different patent policy instruments and reviews their effects on R\&D and economic growth. This part also discusses the distortionary effects and distributional consequences of IPR protection as well as empirical evidence on the effects of patent rights. Then, the second part considers the international aspects of IPR protection. In summary, this paper draws the following conclusions from the literature. Firstly, different patent policy instruments have different effects on R\&D and growth. Secondly, there is empirical evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality. Finally, in an open economy, achieving the globally optimal level of protection requires an international coordination (rather than the harmonization) of IPR protection.},

@article{Taylor09b,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the 100-fold increase in reserve balances at the Federal Reserve during 2008. By looking at the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve and factors influencing the supply and demand for reserves, the paper shows that the increase was due to large purchases of securities and loans to certain sectors and institutions. Such actions constitute a combination of monetary policy and industrial policy, or a mondustrial policy. This characterization raises questions about the future of the Federal Reserve and suggests the need to return to a monetary framework that controls the money supply while the interest rate is zero and establishes rules for setting the interest rate.Business Economics (2009) 44, 63\&ndash;72. doi:10.1057/be.2009.1},

   by using a better specified empirical model, focusing on a study
   population that is less likely to be affected by parameter
   heterogeneity, and controlling for endogeneity using political

@article{OBrien88,
	Abstract = {Between 1660 and 1815 the British government managed to appropriate extraordinary and ever increasing amounts of revenue without much difficulty and without provoking tax revolts. Its success owed something to economic growth, which widened and deepened the base for taxation, but far more to an efficient and politically acceptable selection of the commodities and social groups imposed upon to carry the fiscal burden of its expansionary foreign and military policies. Despite the antipathy they arouse, foreign and military policies. Despite the antipathy they aroused, for administrative and political reasons excises and stamp duties imposed on goods and services produced and sold within the kingdom made the greatest long-term contribution towards Britain's rise to the status of a great power. Even at times of pressing military necessity taxes collected by the central government of an aristocratic state did not become manifestly more regressive.

@article{Bever02,
	Abstract = {While a strong consensus has emerged in the last generation about many sociocultural aspects of witchcraft, the role of gender--why witchcraft was particularly but not exclusively associated with women--has remained problematic. This article asserts that women in early modern Europe were thought more likely to be witches because, the evidence suggests, they were in fact more likely to act like witches. Hostility and violence figured prominently in early modern village and small town life, and women resorted to witch-like behaviors ranging from premeditated poisoning and surreptitious assault through ritual malefic magic to spontaneous displays of intense anger because these were effective means of engaging in conflicts that played to their learned and innate strengths while avoiding forms of struggle they were less well equipped for. The article concludes by suggesting that the intervention of the state in the form of widespread and protracted witch prosecutions played a role in inhibiting witch-like practices and behaviors, and since these were utilized far more often by women than men, helped change the perceived "nature" of women from the Medieval notion that they were particularly violent and lustful to the modern image of women as gentle and asexual.},
